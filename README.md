- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @RajatShenoi
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in programming!
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning [Data Science courses by HarvardX](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science)
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on an extension I plan on making to Google Chrome which stores whatever is **copied** in one place so that the user can simply copy all the required data and go back to the extension to see all the data he has copied. This project will make the user speed up in whatever he does when the user is using the internet to copy and paste a lot of data back and forth to different places.
